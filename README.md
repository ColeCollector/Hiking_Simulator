# **Main Game Idea**
A 2d game made using pygame about walking along a trail with various terrains and obstacles. You can move your thumb to swing your two feet across the screen in order to navigate the terrain. It's a pixel art styled strategy/exploration game. At the start of your journey, you will choose what three items to bring along. Each item offers unique perks, but comes at the cost of being heavy which will impair your movement. You will have to keep track of your stamina and temperature. My friend came up with a lot of the ideas in the game after being on a hiking trip in highschool though he did not implent anything into the game.

## Biomes

## **Game Mechanics**
- Swipe or click to move foot to the desired location.

- Swipe between your feet to jump.

- Ui item selection: decide what to bring with you in your backpack.

- Being too heavy makes moving foot slower.

- A stamina bar that goes down when you slip.
  
- A heat bar fluctuates depending on the biome.

- Foot wetness when you step in water causing temperature decrease.
  
## Items:
You are able to choose three items, but you can pick the same item twice to double its effectiveness.
| Item            | Function                                                                                               |
|:---------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Water Bottle    | Stamina will refill 8% faster <br> -2 Walk Radius                                                      |
| Shoes           | Lets you walk 10 % further, though some shoes could make you slip easier                               |
| Clothes         | Permenant + 15Â°C temperature bonus                                                                     |

## Future update wishlist (not in the game yet):

### New Mechanic Ideas:
- Oval around foot instead of Circle
  
- Occasional one time events like dinky bridges or a log walk section.
  
- Occasional need for big jumps with swipes up and then catching it with the thumb movement.
  
- A chance of rain occuring which causes more and larger puddles, slipperier obstacles, heat goes down fast, especially when not moving.
  
- Instead of the water bottle just making stamina increase faster, you could click something at the top to drink water and refill stamina.

- Being heavy makes it hard to jump

- Snowy Biome makes you slide around


### New Biome Ideas:
Seaside flats: 
- a little wet throughout, 
- can wet feet if not careful, 
- brown muck that can be slippery, 
- heat increase faster

Forrest: 
- windy and turny, 
- obstacle heavy, 
- infrequent jumps, 
- boardwalk sections
