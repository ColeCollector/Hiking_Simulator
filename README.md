# **Main Game Idea**
A moble-ish (not fully mobile since its made with pygame) 2d game about walking along a trail with various terrains and obstacles. You can move your thumb to swing your two feet across the screen in order to navagate the terrain. Its a pixel art styled strategy/exploraton game. At the start of your journey you will choose what three items to bring along. Each item offers unique perks, but comes at the cost of being heavy which will impair your movement.


## **Game Mechanics**
### Implemented:
-put thumb/pointer down and swipe to move foot to the necessary location.

-biomes with their own pros and cons.

-ui with backpack options: decide what to include in your pack.

-being too heavy makes it hard to jump and makes moving foot slower.

### Future Mechanic Ideas:
-occasional one time events like dinky bridges or a log walk section.

-occasional need for big jumps with swipes up and then catching it with the thumb movement.

-heat bar to measure health. problems if too hot or too cold(heat exhaustion, hypothermia).

-foot wetness can lead to mlre blisters and an increase in pain/discomfort.

-thirst bar that can lead to dehydration. need to decontaminate water if in creek. if you do not you have a chance of getting sick if you get water too often you can develop dehydration because you need to wait to decontaminate.

-instead of thirst bar, a stamina bar that goes down when you walk.

-add a chance of rain spawning which causes more and larger puddles, slipperier obstacles, heat goes down fast, especially when not moving.

## Items:

| Item            | Function                                                                                               |
|:---------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Water Bottle    | - Stamina will refill faster <br> - Alternatively, you could click something at the top to drink water and refill stamina |
| Shoes           | - Lets you walk further <br> - Some shoes could make you slip easier                                   |
| Clothes         | - Protection from heat                                                                                 |

## Biomes

| biome          | beach      | snowy      | bog        | boulders   |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| **temperature**| hot        | cold       | neutral    | neutral    |
| **difficulty** | easy       | medium     | medium     | hard       |

### Future Biome Ideas:
Seaside flats: 
- a little wet throughout, 
- can wet feet if not careful, 
- brown muck that can be slippery, 
- heat increase faster

Forrest: 
- windy and turny, 
- obstacle heavy, 
- infrequent jumps, 
- boardwalk sections

Ladder sections: 
- often short, 
- high effort, 
- hard if heavy, 
- occasional missing rungs to add difficulty
