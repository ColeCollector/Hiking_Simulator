main game idea
walking about on a trail that has plenty of "turns" and tons of different terrain
vertical design layout


main mechanics ideas
put thumb/pointer down and swipe to move foot to the necessary location
occasional need for big jumps with swipes up and then catching it with the thumb movement
biomes with their own pros and cons
occasional one time events like dinky bridges or a log walk section

extra additions
ui with backpack options:decide what to include in your pack
being too heavy makes it hard to jump and makes moving foot slower
foot wetness can lead to mlre blisters and an increase in pain/discomfort

heat bar to measure health. problems if too hot or too cold(heat exhaustion, hypothermia)
thirst bar that can lead to dehydration. need to decontaminate water if in creek. if you do not you have a chance of getting sick

Alternative: instead of thirst bar, I suggest a stamina bar, 

if you get water too often you can develop dehydration because you need to wait to decontaminate.

=====================
ITEMS:

tent:
-WIP

water-bottle:
-stamina will refill faster
-alternatively you could click something at the top to drink water and that will refil your stamina

sleeping bag:
-lets you skip night-time

shoes:
-lets you walk further
-some shoes could make you slip easier
-bigger jumps?

clothes:
-protection from heat
=====================


biomes
beach: easy mode, walk slower, no obstacles, heat goes up faster
bog: hard shit, frequent puddles, slippery obstacles, lots of jumping, high chances of wet feet, boardwalk sections
boulders: hard if heavy, frequent long jumps, occasional loose rocks
seaside flats: a little wet throughout, can wet feet if not careful, brown muck that can be slippery, heat increase faster
forrest: windy and turny, obstacle heavy, infrequent jumps, boardwalk sections
ladder sections: often short, high effort, hard if heavy, occasional missing rungs to add difficulty
snowy area: cold, you leave footsteps, slippery

weather
rain: more and larger puddles, slipperier obstacles, heat goes down fast, especially in not moving
